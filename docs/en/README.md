# Documentation Index

`docs/` is the official long-form documentation directory for CodexManager.

Its purpose is simple:
- Keep governance notes, release guides, and operating manuals inside the repository.
- Make it easy for new contributors to find the right document without relying on tribal knowledge.

## Project Snapshot

CodexManager is a local desktop + service-process account pool manager and gateway relay for Codex workflows.

- Unified account, usage, and platform-key management.
- Local OpenAI-compatible gateway for Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Claude Code, and third-party tools.
- Supports account routing, model/profile overrides, and aggregate API upstream relays.

## Feature Overview

- Account pool management: groups, tags, ordering, notes, ban recognition, and filtering.
- Batch import/export: multi-file import, desktop recursive folder import, per-account export.
- Usage display: 5-hour + 7-day windows, single-window accounts, and official extra buckets such as Code Review / Spark.
- Platform keys: create, disable, delete, model binding, reasoning tier, and service tier.
- Aggregate API: create/edit/test third-party relay upstreams with supplier naming and priority ordering.
- Plugin center: built-in, private, and custom source modes with task/log views and Rhai integration.
- Local service + gateway: custom bind/listen settings, upstream proxy, total request timeout, stream idle timeout, SSE keepalive, and a unified compatible endpoint.
- Image generation: automatically injects the official Codex `image_generation` tool for `/v1/responses` by default, forwards explicit tools unchanged, and exposes compatible `/v1/images/generations` and `/v1/images/edits` endpoints with `gpt-image-2` as the default image tool model.

## Quick Start

1. Launch desktop app and click **Start Service**.
2. Open **Account Management** and complete account authorization.
3. If callback parsing fails, paste the callback URL for manual parsing.
4. Refresh usage and verify account status.

## Ecosystem Pairing

### OpenCowork

- Repository: [AIDotNet/OpenCowork](https://github.com/AIDotNet/OpenCowork)
- Recommended pairing: use OpenCowork for local file operations, multi-agent execution, workplace messaging, and desktop automation, while CodexManager handles Codex account management, usage tracking, platform keys, and the local gateway entry point.
- Best for: teams that want to separate the execution workspace and office integration from account-pool management and gateway access.
- A simple way to think about it: **OpenCowork executes in the real workspace, CodexManager manages accounts and gateway access.**

## Contribution rules

### Commit documentation when it
- remains useful for future contributors,
- affects development, testing, release, or troubleshooting,
- or serves as a long-term source of truth.

### Do not commit documentation when it is
- a temporary draft,
- personal working notes,
- a disposable intermediate file,
- or a local-only experiment record.

## Ignored patterns
- `docs/**/*.tmp.md`
- `docs/**/*.local.md`

Do not use those suffixes for formal documentation.

## Naming

```text
Long-lived documents: topic.md
One-off reports: yyyyMMddHHmmssfff_topic.md
```

## Maintenance notes
- Add important governance material under `docs/` instead of expanding the README indefinitely.
- Keep version history in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Keep architecture notes in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Keep collaboration rules in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Put unreleased change details in `CHANGELOG.md`; keep the README focused on navigation and summary.
