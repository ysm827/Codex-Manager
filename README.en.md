## Source Notes
> This project was built under my direction with AI assistance: Codex (98%) and Gemini (2%). If you run into issues while using it, please communicate in a friendly way. I open-sourced it because I thought it could help someone, and the core functionality is already usable.
> I also do not have enough environments to verify every package on every platform. I still have a day job, and I cannot afford devices like Macs, so I only guarantee availability for the Windows desktop app. If there are issues on other platforms, please report them in the community group or submit Issues after sufficient testing. I will handle them when I have time.
> Finally, thanks to everyone who reported platform-specific issues in the group and helped with part of the testing.

## Recent Changes
  - Current latest version: `v0.1.17` (2026-04-05, pre-release)
  - Request logs now distinguish between the client-explicit service tier and the effective service tier that actually goes upstream after platform-key overrides, so `auto` no longer obscures whether a default `Fast` setting was really applied.
  - Regular platform keys now use a wildcard-compatible protocol mode for Codex and Claude Code. The gateway routes `/v1/messages*` with Claude semantics and other standard paths with Codex / OpenAI semantics, so separate keys are no longer required for those clients.
  - The settings page now includes model forward rules with `pattern=target` syntax, for example `spark*=gpt-5.4-mini`. Platform-key bound models still take precedence over global forwarding rules.
  - The account-page quota detail popup has also been realigned so it now sits on the vertical midpoint of the quota overview card, making the 5-hour, 7-day, and extra quota details feel anchored to the correct hover target instead of floating too high.
  - Version alignment for this round is complete too: the workspace, frontend package, Tauri desktop app, lockfile, README, and CHANGELOG have all been updated to `0.1.17`.

### Recent Commit Summary
- `a2c0e05`: switched platform-key protocol handling to wildcard path-based routing and added global model forwarding rules.
- `4389764`: added effective service-tier logging so request logs now separate client-explicit and actually applied values.
- `83bdb96`: expanded account-page and usage-modal quota rendering so refreshes now surface both standard and extra quota windows.
- `41375a4`: added `/v1/responses` WebSocket request support and transport-aware request logging.
- `b762a65`: fixed `service_tier` log semantics and added raw client-side `service_tier` diagnostics for both HTTP and WebSocket requests.
- `7e7b76f`: separated leftover formatting-only changes into their own cleanup commit.
- `be73359`: adjusted abbreviated token displays to keep two decimal places for more stable number formatting across dashboard, logs, and platform key pages.
- `dfb4494`: merged PR #86, which consolidates fixes for Anthropic SSE tool-call argument compatibility during streaming bridge conversion.
- `981bc6e`: aliased `chat.completion` usage fields to OpenAI `prompt/completion tokens`, reducing usage accounting mismatches.
- `480f847`: fixed a case where empty `edits` in completed events could overwrite streamed edit arguments.
- `7bbc5fc`: fixed `chat/completions` SSE handling so completed tool arguments are merged correctly even when content is non-empty.
- `aa2c09c`: merged streamed tool arguments before Anthropic SSE conversion to avoid losing arguments at completion time.
- `29c3b6b`: prevented placeholder tool arguments from wiping real streamed edit payloads, further hardening streaming tool-call stability.
- `c1844b7`: standardized stream disconnect messaging to a clearer network-jitter style prompt.
- `a89cd9c`: preserved upstream raw error text and tightened log messaging to make real failures easier to diagnose.
- `8d619a0`: added export-for-selected-accounts support and improved account switching during usage refresh.

## Feature Overview
- Account pool management: groups, tags, sorting, notes, ban detection, and banned-account filtering
- Bulk import / export: supports multi-file import, recursive JSON folder import on desktop, and single-file export per account
- Usage display: supports the standard 5-hour + 7-day windows, 7-day-only accounts, and extra quota windows such as Code Review / Spark, with refreshes showing each window's remaining percentage and reset time
- Authorized login: browser authorization plus manual callback parsing
- Platform keys: create, disable, delete, model binding, reasoning effort, and service tier (`Follow Request` / `Fast` / `Flex`)
- Aggregate API: manage third-party minimal relay upstreams, with create, edit, connectivity testing, provider name, sort priority, and grouped display by Codex / Claude
- Plugin center: route at `/plugins/`, supports built-in curated, enterprise private, and custom-source market modes, and provides plugin lists, tasks, logs, and Rhai integration interfaces
- Settings page: supports the `System Derive` button, single-account concurrency limit, and a more conservative high-concurrency degradation strategy
- System internal interface inventory: lists all currently available desktop commands, service RPC methods, and plugin built-in functions
- Local service: auto-start, customizable port, and listen address
- Local gateway: provides one unified OpenAI-compatible endpoint for CLI tools and third-party tooling

## Quick Start
1. Launch the desktop app and click `Start Service`.
2. Go to `Account Management`, add an account, and complete authorization.
3. If callback parsing fails, paste the callback URL to complete parsing manually.
4. Refresh usage and confirm the account status.

## Default Data Directory
- By default, the desktop app writes the SQLite database to the app data directory, with the fixed filename `codexmanager.db`.
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\com.codexmanager.desktop\\codexmanager.db`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/com.codexmanager.desktop/codexmanager.db`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/com.codexmanager.desktop/codexmanager.db`
- If you need to adjust the database, proxy, listen address, or other runtime configuration, continue with [Environment Variables and Runtime Configuration](docs/report/环境变量与运行配置说明.md).

## Page Overview
### Desktop App
- Account Management: centrally import, export, and refresh accounts and usage, with low-quota / banned filters and reset-time display
- Platform Keys: bind platform keys by model, reasoning effort, and service tier, and view invocation logs
- Plugin Center: `/plugins/` route with built-in curated / enterprise private / custom-source market switching, plugin install, enable/disable, tasks, logs, and Rhai integration
- Settings: centrally manage ports, listen address, proxy, theme, auto-update, and background behavior

### Service Edition
- `codexmanager-service`: provides a local OpenAI-compatible gateway
- `codexmanager-web`: provides a browser management interface
- `codexmanager-start`: launches service + web with one command
